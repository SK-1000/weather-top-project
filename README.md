# weather-top-project

The concept of this weather top project is as follows:

The Owners of a consumer level weather station
purchase and install a weather station kit.
- Periodically members submit weather reports
  from their station to a website, capturing
  readings from the station at a specific time
- The application displays weather analytics for
  the station
- The owner may own multiple stations


This application allows users to sign up to the weather top application and will store their member details
The user can log into the application
They then have an option to add a station to their account. They are requested to provide a station name as well as the latitude and longitude of that station.
Once the station has been added, the user can add the following readings for the station:

-Weather code(number in range 100-800) These weather codes are then displayed on the latest readings station summary dashboard in descriptive terminology. Any
code provided outside this range is displayed as an invalid code. An icon representing this weather code will also be displayed in a pink colour.

-Temperature(c). The user can enter the current temperature in Celsius. The application will also convert this to fahrenheit and display in the latest readings station summary dashboard.
The Minimum and maximum readings for this station is also displayed as well as a trend icon highlighting whether the temp are increasing decreasing or consistent.

-WindSpeed(Km/hr). The customer enters a wind speed in bft. This input was then used to also display the wind compass and wind chill readings. The minimum and maximum
wind speed readings are also displayed as well as a trend icon to show if wind has been increasing decreasing or consistent.

-Pressure- The user can enter the current pressure value. The dashboard also displays minimum and maximum pressure as well as a trend icon to measure, increase decreasing or consisent
pressure.

Each reading has a data time stamp displayed on when it was added to the application. There is also delete reading functionality.

There is an option for a user to delete a station.

There is a update Personal Access Details page on the menu however unfortunately, this is not completed.
